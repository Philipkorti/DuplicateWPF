# DuplicateWPF

First you need to select a directory with the files that you want to check for duplicates. (It can also contain more folders, the program will go through all the folders).
Then you need to specify a filetype in the options. 

Now you will see this:

You can choose between the different duplicates and the program will display the duplicate on the right side.
